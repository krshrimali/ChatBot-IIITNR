# Meetings: #
Meeting - 1. Wed. , 1st August : Discuss the Project and with client:

1. Project Discussion:
  1.1 Topics discussed. Demos found.
  1.2 Is UI the priority? (Question) Mainly not. Because of IIIT NR's own website layout, it shouldn't be. ChatBot has to be kept simple and easy to load.
  1.3 Rivescript Module is the best find? Any better finds? - Rivescript is easy to install, data format is understandable. 
2. Client :
  2.1 Topic - Good.
  2.2 UI - Not priority. Use college's template.
  2.3 RiveScript - our choice. Should be open source & fast.

Meeting - 2. Tuesday, 7th August : With Client.

1. Client:
  1.1 UI - Add contact us, college image and menu.
  1.2 Prepare a sample admission chat bot. We'll deploy it and test it. Take data from FAQs on the website.
